# Multiclass Animal Detection For CCTV by YOLOV5

This project aims to train the YOLOv5 model to detect multiple classes of animals in video footage. By leveraging the power of YOLOv5, we can identify different animals in real-time, which can be particularly useful in various scenarios such as wildlife monitoring, animal behavior studies, and ensuring public safety in areas where wildlife frequently interacts with humans.
